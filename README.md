# ChemAid

## Introduction
Welcome to the ChemAid, a virtual tool designed to assist you with various chemistry calculations and tasks. This program is authored by Gavin Austin.

## Features
- Stoichiometry: Perform stoichiometric calculations based on the given input of mass, moles, or molecules of an element or compound.
- Balance Equations: Coming soon.
- And More! Coming soon.
- Quit: Exit the program.

## Getting Started
To begin, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run the `ChemistryAssistantMain` class.

## Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose between different options:
- **Stoichiometry**: Enter the element or compound, along with the given mass, moles, or molecules, to calculate related properties.
- **Balance Equations**: This feature is not yet implemented.
- **Quit**: Exit the program.
